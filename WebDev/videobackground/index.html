				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>My name is Logan Wenzel, and I am 19 years old. I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree for the field of computer science. I currently study at The State University of New York at Fredonia, where I am on track to graduate in the Spring of 2018. Until then I am always looking for opportunities to gain experience with programming through internships, work, and at many times just for the enjoyment. </p>
				<p>My passions include finding solutions to problems from Project Euler, tinkering with my website, and recreating retro games. The programming languages I have on my tool belt include, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and C/C++. I also am knowledgeable with Git and Mercurial.</p>
